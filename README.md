## Skills Demonstrated

This project solves the following problem statement:

> **Build a tool that analyzes sentiment trends for specific topics or hashtags across social media. Use a healthcare-focused use case to demonstrate:**
>
> - AI/ML: Used VADER for sentiment scoring
> - Critical Thinking: Handled text noise and sarcasm limitations
> - Problem Solving: Dealt with API rate limits and data handling
> - Modular Structure: Split code into `main.py` (data) and `app.py` (UI)
> - Clear Architecture: API → NLP → CSV → Streamlit dashboard
